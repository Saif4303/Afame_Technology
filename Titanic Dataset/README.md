# Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset widely used in machine learning tutorials and competitions due to its simplicity and historical significance. The goal of this model is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset consists of the following features:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age in years
- SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Model
The machine learning model in this repository is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The model is trained on a portion of the Titanic dataset and evaluated on another portion to assess its performance.

## Files
- `Titanic_Dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the data (passenger information).

## Usage
To run the model:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open `Titanic_Dataset.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) are documented in the notebook.
